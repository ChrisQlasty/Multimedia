| **Digit wizard** PC app for drawing digits in the air utilizing the Intel RealSense F200 camera. Digits are recognized by a CNN model built with Keras and the inference is done thanks to the TensorFlowSharp. For GitHub repo of the project click [here](https://github.com/ChrisQlasty/DigitWizard). | [<img src="./img/DigWiz.png">](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj1jtxOkz2A&list=PL7O2QC3VBSZ2cHDJ8h-QumI3nmG9e7iEM&index=3) |
| **Demo at UbiComp '16** - movie, which was assisting the demonstration stand, with the gesture sensor connected to Odroid-X SBC. It was related with the paper titled _["Semi complex navigation with an active optical gesture sensor"](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2971375)_.| [<img src="./img/UbiC.png">](http://www.e-glasses.net/presentations/eGlasses_Ubicomp_2016.mp4) |
| **LabSeq** Android app for secure exchange of patient laboratory data. It was presented at **Human System Interactions 2014** conference with the paper titled _["Interaction with medical data using QR-codes"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6860471)_. | [<img src="./img/qrCodes.png">](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4PircXlp2I&list=PL7O2QC3VBSZ2cHDJ8h-QumI3nmG9e7iEM&index=1) |
| **eDoctor** - Android application made at studies for doctors to have quick access to data of hospitalized patients. It was developed into LabSeq app mentioned above. | [<img src="./img/eDoc.png">](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXtrWYJs6Lk&list=PL7O2QC3VBSZ2cHDJ8h-QumI3nmG9e7iEM&index=2) |
